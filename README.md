# 2020 Mini Challenge for Web Design and Programming

## Client

### CMH Guards

## About

An industrial manufacturing company that fabricates what they describe as “oil-tight chain guards” — or dust-proof custom metal housings for sprocket and chain assemblies that are filled with an oil bath to keep the chain lubricated while revolving around the gear. Applications typically include the drivetrain assembly for a conveyor belt in outdoor applications to move raw materials, such as mining.

## Requirements

Develop an “extra large-sized” view of a Bootstrap 4 responsive, single web page. No other responsive size versions are needed for this challenge. You have full creative license to develop a visually compelling web page, leveraging interesting and unique web programming functionality. (Consider such elements as parallax sliding background images, fixed/top anchored logo header navigation bars, contact form, embedding video (provided) into the page.)

## Deliverables

1. Part 1: Wireframe of single web page

- Can be hand-sketched (provide scans) or computer-generated (Adobe XD, Illustrator or Photoshop)

2. Part 2: Layout design of a single web page

- Please provide PDF or JPG of static layout
- Create a layout in Illustrator or Photoshop

3. Part 3: “Live” programmed web page based on your design

- Please provide either upload to a staged link that can be shared via URL or provide ZIP file with HTML, CSS, linked assets (including images, backgrounds, javascript, etc. Consider basic SEO best practices such as H1, H2, H3 headers, page descriptions, etc.
- Target Google Chrome web browser

## Goal

To identify and assess the organization of thought, planning of design, proficiency with essential software, creative aptitude and understanding/implementation of HTML and CSS when going from front-end web design to executing and programming for a “live” web page.
